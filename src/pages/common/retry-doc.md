If `Adobe I/O Events` fails to receive a successful response code from your webhook within the configured timeout window, it retries the request, including a special header `x-adobe-retry-count`. This header indicates how many times the delivery of an event or a batch of events has been attempted.

- Default webhooks: The timeout is 10 seconds.
- [Runtime Actions as webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/events/docs/guides/runtime-webhooks/): The timeout is 60 seconds.

**Note:** The timeout spans the entire delivery attempt, including the overhead of setting up the HTTP connection. This means that if your webhook handler responds in exactly 10 seconds (or 60 seconds for Runtime Actions), the delivery will still fail due to the additional overhead of setting up the connection.

Please note that if an event delivery fails with a response status code of [429 Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429), or with any response status code in the range of 500 to 599 except for [505 HTTP Version Not Supported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/505), then those events are retried. Events that fail with any other response status codes are **not retried**.

`Adobe I/O Events` will keep on retrying delivery to your webhook for **24 hours** using exponential and fixed backoff strategies. The first retry is attempted after 1 minute and the period between retries doubles after each attempt, but is at most 15 minutes (see below table outlining the retry pattern).
\<br/\>

| Retry Attempt        | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5   | 6   | 7   | ... |
|----------------------|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Retry After Interval | 1m | 2m | 4m | 8m | 15m | 15m | 15m | ... |

*Please note that above retry intervals are not guaranteed and may vary in few exception scenarios.*

`Adobe I/O Events` changes the state of an event registration based on the below criteria:

- **UNSTABLE** - Event registration is marked as unstable if, in the last 30 minutes, over 80% of at least 10 deliveries were unsuccessful.
- **DISABLED** - Event registration is marked as disabled if, in the last 24 hours, over 80% of at least 10 deliveries were unsuccessful.
- **ACTIVE**  - Event registration is marked as active if, in the last 30 minutes, over 80% of at least 10 deliveries were successful.

For an **Unstable** event registration `Adobe I/O Events` still keeps on attempting delivery. This gives you sufficient time to restore your webhook, and avoid it from getting marked as Disabled. Once restored, it will be marked as **Active** on the next successful event delivery.

If all retry attempts get exhausted and the event still isn't delivered (webhook not responding or responding with a non `2XX` response) or the registration is still in **Unstable** state, `Adobe I/O Events` drops the events, marks the event registration as **Disabled**, and stops sending any further events.

An email notification is sent to the admins of the organization when a webhook endpoint is marked as **Unstable** or **Disabled**.

Here you can see a sample email notification sent when a registration is marked as **Unstable**:

A similar email notification is sent when a registration is marked as **Disabled**.
