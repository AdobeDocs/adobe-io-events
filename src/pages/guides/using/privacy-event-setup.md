# Setting up Privacy events with Adobe I/O Events

Privacy events are messages provided by Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service, that leverage Adobe I/O Events sent to a configured webhook in order to facilitate efficient job request automation. They reduce or eliminate the need to poll the Privacy Service API in order to check if a job is complete or if a certain milestone within a workflow has been reached.

For more information on Privacy events, including how to subscribe, please review the steps provided in the [Subscribe to Privacy events](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/privacy/privacy-events.html) documentation.
