# Setting up Marketo Lead Activity Data Stream with Adobe I/O Events

These instructions describe how to set up and get started using Adobe I/O Events for Marketo lead-based activities and change events.

## Introduction

The Lead Activity Data Stream provides near real-time streaming of audit tracking Lead Activities where large volumes of Lead Activities can be sent to a customerâ€™s external system. Streams enable customers to effectively audit Lead-related events, usage patterns, provide views into Lead changes and trigger processes and workflows based upon the different types of Lead Events.

## Setup Adobe I/O

See [Getting Started with Adobe I/O Events](../../../index.md)

For basic instructions for this use case, starting from [console.adobe.io](https://developer.adobe.com/console/):

*When prompted, click the designated button to proceed*:

- Select `Create new project`

  ![Create new project](../../img/console_create_new_project.png "Quick Start")

- Select `Add event`

  ![Add event](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup2.png "Get started with your new project by adding an event subscription")

- Filter by `Experience Cloud`
- Select `Marketo Lead Activity Data Stream`

  ![Provider selection](../../img/LeadActivityDataStreamIOSetup3.png "Select event provider")

- Subscribe to the lead-driven change events of your choosing

  ![Event selection](../../img/LeadActivityDataStreamIOSetup4.png "Select event subscriptions")

- Set up OAuth Server-to-Server Credentials

  ![Set up credentials](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup5.png "Set up credentials")

- Set up Event Registration

  ![Complete registration](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup6.png "Complete registration")

  - Provide a name and description for this event subscription
  - Optionally choose whether to enable Webhook or Runtime action
    - Enable Webhook
      - We recommend batch over single webhooks
      - For `Webhook URL` a public https endpoint must be provided
      - The endpoint must be able to handle get and post requests
      - The get request must respond with the challenge query if it exists
      - The post request must respond that it received the message or the webhook will re-attempt to send several times before giving up and automatically disabling the webhook sends
    - Enable Runtime action
      - [See Setting up your Runtime Environment](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/get_started/runtime_getting_started/)
      - Select a pre-made runtime action/runtime namespace
- After Saving

  ![Verify setup](../../img/LeadActivityDataStreamIOSetup7.png "Verify setup")

  - Verify that the Status is `Active`
  - If Webhook was selected, verify that it successfully passed the challenge without errors

### Event Data Structure

Events are structured in JSON format using the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) spec

### Data Field Definitions

Many of the fields are common across the different types of events.  The `data` object will contain the specific details of the event.
In particular, the `attributes` array will contain a subset of all possible attributes (or none at all!) depending on the event type, and the event context.

| Field               | Type              | Description                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| eventid             | String            | Unique UUID generated per event                   |
| specversion         | String            | CloudEvents version specification being used      |
| type                | String            | Type of event used for event subscription routing |
| source              | String            | Context in which an event happened                |
| id                  | String            | Unique UUID generated per event                   |
| time                | String (DateTime) | Timestamp of the completion of the action         |
| datacontenttype     | String            | Content type of the data object                   |
| data                | Object            | Event data object (**see below**)                 |
| recipientclientid   | String            | The ID of the client that is receiving the event  |

The `type` field will always be the Event Type name, all lowercase with spaces removed, appended to the string "**com.adobe.platform.marketo.activity.standard**". For example, for the "Open Email" Event Type, the `type` string will be "**com.adobe.platform.marketo.activity.standard.openemail**".

All customer-defined activity types will be delivered with an identical event type "**com.adobe.platform.marketo.activity.custom**", with no suffix.

The `data` field contains the following data:

| Field                   | Type              | Description                                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| munchkinId              | String            | The Munchkin ID of the Marketo instance                             |
| leadId                  | String (Number)   | The ID of the lead that the event is related to                     |
| activityDate            | String (DateTime) | The timestamp of the event                                          |
| activityTypeId          | Number            | The ID of the activity type                                         |
| activityType            | String            | The name of the activity type                                       |
| activityLogItemId       | Number            | The ID of the activity log item                                     |
| primaryAttributeValueId | Number            | The ID of the primary modified attribute                            |
| primaryAttributeValue   | String            | The value of the primary modified attribute                         |
| programId               | Number            | (**optional**) The ID of the program the lead is associated with    |
| programName             | String            | (**optional**) The name of the program the lead is associated with  |
| campaignId              | Number            | (**optional**) The ID of the campaign the lead is associated with   |
| campaignName            | String            | (**optional**) The name of the campaign the lead is associated with |
| attributes              | Array (Attribute) | An array of attribute objects (**see below**)                       |

And finally, all Attribute objects in the `attributes` array will contain the following fields:

| Field     | Type   | Description                    |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| name      | String | The name of the attribute      |
| dataType  | String | The data type of the attribute |
| value     | Any    | The value of the attribute     |

Some events may include additional metadata with their response. You are always able to emit a sample event for every
event type from within the Adobe Developer Console to see an example of the event structure.

## Event List

These are all of the currently supported Lead Activity Event Types. If you have a "firehose" endpoint configured that is subscribed to more than one event type, you can identify the type of event in three different ways.

Here are examples using the "Open Email" event type:

1. Text match on the `activityType` field under the `data` object (e.g. `payload.data.activityType` = "Open Email")
2. Number match on the `actitityTypeId` field under the `data` object (e.g. `payload.data.activityTypeId` = 10)
3. Text match on the `type` field with the concatenated, lower-cased Event Type (e.g. `payload.type` = "com.adobe.platform.marketo.activity.standard.openemail")

| Event Type                      | Event ID |
