# Setting up Marketo User Audit Data Stream with Adobe I/O Events

These instructions describe how to set up and get started using Adobe I/O Events for Marketo user-driven change events.  You can use Adobe I/O for streaming Marketo user-driven change events such as the modification of emails, campaigns, and landing pages.

## Introduction

User Audit Data Stream provides all the user-driven change events that are shown in the MLM Audit Trail as an event stream to which you can subscribe.

## Setup User Audit Data Stream in Marketo

Data Streams are available to those that have purchased a Marketo Engage Performance Tier Package. Once a Performance Tier agreement is in place, work with your TAM and Customer Engineering team to enable this Data Stream for your subscription.

We typically just need to know the MunchkinId for the subscription, and the associated Adobe OrgId, which enables access to the Adobe IO Developer Console.

## Setup Adobe I/O

See [Getting Started with Adobe I/O Events](/src/pages/index.md)

For basic instructions for this use case, starting from [console.adobe.io](/console/):

*When prompted, click the designated button to proceed*

- Select `Create new project`

  ![Create new project](../../img/console_create_new_project.png "Quick Start")

- Select `Add event`

  ![Add event](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup2.png "Get started with your new project by adding an event subscription")

- Filter by `Experience Cloud`
- Select `Marketo User Audit Data Stream`

  ![Provider selection](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup3.png "Select event provider")

- Subscribe to the user driven change events of your choosing

  ![Event selection](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup4.png "Select event subscriptions")

- Set up OAuth Server-to-Server Credentials

  ![Set up credentials](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup5.png "Set up credentials")

- Set up Event Registration

  ![Complete registration](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup6.png "Complete registration")

  - Provide a name and description for this event subscription
  - Optionally choose whether to enable Webhook or Runtime action
    - Enable Webhook
      - We recommend batch over single webhooks
      - For `Webhook URL` a public https endpoint must be provided
      - The endpoint must be able to handle get and post requests
      - The get request must respond with the challenge query if it exists
      - The post request must respond that it received the message or the webhook will re-attempt to send several times before giving up and automatically disabling the webhook sends
    - Enable Runtime action
      - [See Setting up your Runtime Environment](/runtime/docs/guides/getting-started/)
      - Select a pre-made runtime action/runtime namespace
- After Saving

  ![Verify setup](../../img/UserAuditDataStreamIOSetup7.png "Verify setup")
  
  - Verify that the Status is `Active`
  - If Webhook was selected, verify that it successfully passed the challenge without errors

### Event Data Structure

Events are structured in JSON format using the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) spec
