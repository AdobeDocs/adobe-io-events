# Asset Events

An Asset Event is a record of change (creation, update, or deletion) to one or more [resources](asset-events-glossary.md#resource) of an [asset](asset-events-glossary.md#asset) stored on Content Platform. Asset Events are essential to developers who wish to extend the Platform by building integrations, workflows, applications, etc. This is because Events allow clients to track the state of various assets without resorting to polling for changes, a task that adds latency and creates additional load to the services, especially as Platform usage grows significantly.
