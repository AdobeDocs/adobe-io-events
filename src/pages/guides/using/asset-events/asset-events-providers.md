# Asset Events Providers

There are several different Asset Events providers (i.e., Adobe applications that generate events). Once you have created a project at https://developer.adobe.com/console and selected `Add Event`, you can select which events you want to receive from which providers. Below are all the event providers, along with their respective events.

**Note**: Regardless of which provider is generating events, the structure and [properties](asset-events-properties.md) of the events remains consistent.
