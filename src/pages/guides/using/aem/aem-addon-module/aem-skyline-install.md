# AEM Events powered by Add-On Module on AEM as a Cloud Service

<AemAddonModuleDeprecationNotice />

This documentation has instructions to set up I/O Events integrations with AEM as a Cloud Service powered by the AEM add-on module.

To integrate with AEM On Premise, please refer to the other associated [documentation](aem-on-premise-install.md).

To install and configure the AEM add-on module on AEM as a Cloud Service:

1. [Set up your workspace in the Adobe Developer Console](aem-console-setup.md)
2. Use Cloud Manager environment variables to power your [OSGI configuration](aem-workspace-setup.md).
3. Optionally do some more [configuration fine tuning](aem-advanced-configurations.md).
4. Deploy these osgi configurations, together with `aem-aio-events` add-on module using Cloud Manager. You may refer to this working sample [aio-aem-events-sample](https://github.com/francoisledroff/aio-aem-events-sample).
5. Trigger `aem-aio-events` add-on module [status check endpoint](aem-status-check.md).
