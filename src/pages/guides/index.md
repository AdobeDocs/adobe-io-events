# Introduction to Adobe I/O Events Webhooks

With Adobe I/O Events webhooks, your application can sign up to be notified whenever certain events occur.
For example, when a user uploads a asset, this action generates an event.
With the right webhook in place, your application is instantly notified that this event happened.

Please refer to the `Adobe Developer Console` documentation on how to [Add Events to a project](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/services/services-add-event/)

To start receiving events, you create an event registration specifying a webhook URL and the types of events you want to receive. Each event will result in a HTTP request to the given URL, notifying your application. This guide provides an introduction to webhooks.

## Getting started

An **Event** is a JSON object that describes something that happened. Events originate from **Event Providers**. Each event provider publishes specific types of events, identified by an **Event Code**. A **Webhook URL** receives event JSON objects as HTTP POST requests. You start receiving events by creating an **Event Registration**, providing a name, description, webhook URL, and a list of **Event Types** you are interested in.

### Webhook example

Acme Inc. wants to be notified when a new file is uploaded to Adobe Creative Cloud Assets, so it creates the following event registration:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Webhook",
  "description": "Listen for newly created files",
  "webhook_url": "https://acme.example.com/webhook",
  "events_of_interest": [
    {
      "provider": "ccstorage", 
      "event_code": "asset_created"
    }
  ]
}
```
Now when a file is uploaded, Adobe I/O Events performs the following HTTP request:

```http
POST https://acme.example.com/webhook HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json

{
  "@id": "82235bac-2b81-4e70-90b5-2bd1f04b5c7b",
  "@type": "xdmCreated",
  "xdmEventEnvelope:objectType": "xdmAsset",
  "activitystreams:published": "2016-07-16T19:20:30+01:00",
  "activitystreams:to": {
    "xdmImsOrg:id": "08B3E5CE5822FC520A494229@AdobeOrg",
    "@type": "xdmImsOrg"
  },
  "activitystreams:generator": {
    "xdmContentRepository:root": "http://francois.corp.adobe.com:4502/",
    "@type": "xdmContentRepository"
  },
  "activitystreams:actor": {
    "xdmAemUser:id": "admin",
    "@type": "xdmAemUser"
  },
  "activitystreams:object": {
    "@type": "xdmAsset",
    "xdmAsset:asset_id": "urn:aaid:aem:4123ba4c-93a8-4c5d-b979-ffbbe4318185",
    "xdmAsset:asset_name": "Fx_DUKE-small.png",
    "xdmAsset:etag": "6fc55d0389d856ae7deccebba54f110e",
    "xdmAsset:path": "/content/dam/Fx_DUKE-small.png",
    "xdmAsset:format": "image/png"
  },
  "@context": {
    "activitystreams": "http://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#",
    "xdmEventEnvelope": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/eventenvelope#",
    "xdmAsset": "http://ns.adobe.com/xdm/assets/asset#",
    "xdmImsOrg": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/ims/organization#",
    "xdmContentRepository": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/content/repository",
    "xdmAemUser": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/aem/user#",
    "xdmCreated": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/event/created#"
  }
}
```

## Your first webhook

Before you can register a webhook, the webhook needs to be online and operational. If not, then the event registration will fail. So you need to take care of setting that up first. Your webhook must be hosted on a server. For development, you may use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site), but ensure you complete the [asynchronous validation](#asynchronous-validation) for it to be considered functional.

For production, your webhook needs to:

- Be accessible from the internet (not using localhost)
- Be reachable over HTTPS
- Correctly respond to a "challenge" request
