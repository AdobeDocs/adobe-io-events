# Subscriber Defined Filtering UI Guide

This guide walks you through creating a **subscriber-defined filter** for an event registration using the Adobe Developer Console. You will also learn how to test the filter against sample events and apply it with the appropriate event patterns.

## Getting Started

We assume you already have a Registration for which [SDF is applicable](#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

- An active Adobe I/O Events registration which is compatible with SDF:
  - Only includes [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) deliveries.
  - [AWS EventBridge](../amazon-eventbridge/index.md) is not configured among the delivery methods.
- Access to the Adobe I/O Events API with proper authentication
  - You can either use the Developer Console or add your filters through the [Registration APIs](../api/registration-api.md)
- Understanding of JSON syntax and your event payload structure
  - Check the [filtering language details](dsl.md)

## Step 1: Navigate to the Event Filtering Tab

1. Open your event registration in the Adobe Developer Console.
2. Navigate to the **Event Filtering** tab.

## Step 2: Create a New Subscriber-Defined Filter

1. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the filter.
   > **Tip:** Provide meaningful names so you can easily identify filters later.

## Step 3: Define the Filter Logic

1. Select the appropriate **event pattern** from the dropdown.
   >For a list of supported event patterns and practical examples, refer to the [DSL reference guide](./dsl.md).

2. In the filter definition editor, specify the event attributes to apply the filter on.
   >You can open a sample event payload in the sample event editor side-by-side to use as a reference while writing your filter definition.

## Step 4: Test the Filter Against Sample Events

1. Click **Test filter** to test your filter behavior against all sample events.
2. Review whether each sample event passes or fails the filter.

## Step 5: Refine and Re-Test

1. Select a sample event from the available list.
2. Edit the values in the sample event JSON. For example, modify a field value to test edge cases.
3. Click **Test filter** to test your filter behavior against all sample events, including the custom sample event you just created.

## Step 6: Apply the Filter

1. Once you are satisfied with the filter definition, click **Apply Filter**.
2. The new filter is now active for this event registration.
