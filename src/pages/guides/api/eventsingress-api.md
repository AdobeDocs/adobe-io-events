# Events Publishing API

## Prerequisites

* Create a project and a workspace in the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/projects-empty)
* Add the `I/O Management API` in this Adobe Developer Console workspace
* [Generate an OAuth Server-to-Server token](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/credentials)
* Using [Adobe I/O Events Provider API](provider-api.md)
   * create your own `Custom Events Provider`
   * create at least one `Event Metadata` associated with the above

Data Residency:

Please note that all custom events are stored in the **United States (US)** region.  

## Throttling Policy

We do have a throttling policy in place, we accept up to 3,000 requests / 5 secs per api-key.
Your throttled requests will receive a HTTP Status 429 (Too Many Requests) response
with a `Retry-After` header, following the [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3) HTTP standard.

## Test Drive

Once its `Event Metadata` is persisted in Adobe I/O Events (see above prerequisites),
your `Custom Events Provider` can start publishing its
[CloudEvents]( https://cloudevents.io) to Adobe I/O Events publishing endpoint (`https://eventsingress.adobe.io`).

Please follow [CloudEvents v1.0 specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md),
here is a sample `curl` command:

```bash
curl -i --location --request POST  \
       --url https://eventsingress.adobe.io \
       --header "x-api-key: $api_key" \
       --header "Authorization: Bearer $oauth_s2s_token" \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json' \
       --header "x-event-phidata: $is_phidata" \
       --data '{
         "datacontenttype": "application/json",
         "specversion": "1.0",
         "source": "urn:uuid:'"${provider_id}"'",
         "type": "'"${event_code}"'",
         "id": "'"${event_id}"'",
         "data": "your event json payload"
         "customattribute" : "cloud events custom extension"
       }'
```

The environment variables used in this `curl` command are computed from the above prerequisites

* `api_key` is the api-key associated with your Adobe Developer Console workspace
* `oauth_s2s_token` is an OAuth Server-to-Server token generated using the set up from the same workspace
* `is_phidata` is a boolean value indicating if the event contains PHI data, and is required for [HIPAA compliance](#hipaa-compliance-support) (defaults to `false` if not provided)
* `provider_id` is your `Custom Events Provider` uuid generated by [Adobe I/O Events Provider API](provider-api.md)
* `event_code` is the `Custom Events Provider`'s `Event Metadata`'s `event_code` as persisted using [Adobe I/O Events Provider API](provider-api.md)
* `event_id` is any id of your choice (examples: UUID, event counter) guaranteeing that `source + id` is unique
for each distinct event see [CloudEvents spec](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#id)
*  as for the value of `data` in the CloudEvents body payload, it can be any json payload.
*  `customattribute` (a.k.a cloud events extensions) are any attributes defined by you following the [CloudEvents attribute naming convention](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#attribute-naming-convention)

The API returns

* HTTP Status 200 (OK) if the event has been processed correctly and there are active registrations for the event
* HTTP Status 204 (No Content) if there are no registrations for the event
* HTTP Status 429 (Too Many Requests) if your api-key is being throttled (see our [Throttling Policy](#throttling-policy))
* as well as the other usual (4xx/5xx) error codes if there was an issue in processing the request
  *  HTTP status 400 is returned if payload failed to deserialize due to being non-compliant as per CloudEvents spec

## HIPAA Compliance Support

I/O Events is compliant with [HIPAA regulation](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html).
The event producers are responsible to signal if the event contains PHI data by setting the optional `x-event-phidata` header to `true` in the request.
When the header is present and set to `true`:

* the resulting CloudEvents-formatted event which is produced will be enriched with a [CloudEvents extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/primer.md#cloudevent-extension-attributes), namely, a `phidata` node, set to `true`,
* with the above `phidata` extension receivers will be able to identify which events contain PHI data and handle them accordingly,
* audit trace logs will be preserved for 1 year in a HIPAA-compliant storage,
* the `id` field in the CloudEvents payload will be used as a `trace-id` for the above audit trace logs.

In the event of an audit, you will need to be able to provide evidences of how the patient data was handled.

### Audit log: storing the mapping between PHI data to ids

It is your responsibility to store the `id` in your own logs or storage solution for traceability.
If you are handling multiple end patients data (PHIs), you should also store what `id` you
produced corresponds to what patient data, to be able to provide information regarding that
patient data in case of an audit specific to that patient.

You can ask I/O Events support to retrieve the audit trace logs for a given set of `ids` you produced.
You can reach the support team through the [Adobe I/O Forums](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-developer/ct-p/adobe-io) on Adobe Experience League.
