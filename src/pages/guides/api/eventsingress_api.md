# Events Publishing API

## Prerequisites

* Create a project and a workspace in the [Adobe Developer Console](/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/projects-empty/)
* Add the `I/O Management API` in this Adobe Developer Console workspace 
* [Generate a JWT token](/developer-console/docs/guides/credentials/)
* Using [Adobe I/O Events Provider API](provider_api.md) 
   * create your own `Custom Events Provider`
   * create at least one `Event Metadata` associated with the above

## Throttling Policy

We do have a throttling policy in place, we accept up to 3,000 requests / 5 secs per api-key.
Your throttled requests will receive a HTTP Status 429 (Too Many Requests) response 
with a `Retry-After` header, following the [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3) HTTP standard.

## Test Drive

Once its `Event Metadata` is persisted in Adobe I/O Events (see above prerequisites),
your `Custom Events Provider` can start publishing its 
[CloudEvents]( https://cloudevents.io) to Adobe I/O Events publishing endpoint (`https://eventsingress.adobe.io`).

Please follow [CloudEvents v1.0 specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md), 
here is a sample `curl` command:

     curl -i --location --request POST  \
             --url https://eventsingress.adobe.io \
             --header "x-api-key: $api_key" \
             --header "Authorization: Bearer $jwt_token" \
             --header 'Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json' \
             --data '{
               "datacontenttype": "application/json",
               "specversion": "1.0",
               "source": "urn:uuid:'"${provider_id}"'",
               "type": "'"${event_code}"'",
               "id": "'"${event_id}"'",
               "data": "your event json payload"
             }'


The environment variables used in this `curl` command are computed from the above prerequisites
* `api_key` is the api-key associated with your Adobe Developer Console workspace
* `jwt_token` is a jwt token generated using the set up from the same workspace
* `provider_id` is your `Custom Events Provider` uuid generated by [Adobe I/O Events Provider API](../api/provider_api.md)
* `event_code` is the `Custom Events Provider`'s `Event Metadata`'s `event_code` as persisted using [Adobe I/O Events Provider API](../api/provider_api.md)
* `event_id` is any id of your choice (examples: UUID, event counter) guaranteeing that `source + id` is unique 
for each distinct event see [CloudEvents spec](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#id)
*  as for the value of `data` in the CloudEvents body payload, it can be any json payload.

The API returns
* HTTP Status 200 (OK) if the event has been processed correctly and there are active registrations for the event,
* HTTP Status 204 (No Content) if there are no registrations for the event,
* HTTP Status 429 (Too Many Requests) if your api-key is being throttled (see our [Throttling Policy](#throttling-policy)).
* as well as the usual (4xx/5xx) error codes if there was an issue in processing the request.
