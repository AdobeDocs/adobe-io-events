# App Builder with IO Events

In this guide, you will learn to leverage the power of IO Events to build event-driven applications with Adobe Developer App Builder.
You can listen to events coming from various Adobe Products and Services and build applications that respond to or process these events.

## Prerequisites

You will first need to visit [Adobe Developer Console](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui) and create a new project from template in your organization and set up the workspaces using App Builder template. For detailed instructions, follow the steps outlined in this tutorial for [creating a new project from template](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/projects-template).
