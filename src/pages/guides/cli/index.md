# Events Plugin for Adobe I/O CLI

This guide includes step by step instructions for setting up and using the Events Plugin for the Adobe I/O CLI.

In addition to the information provided in this guide, you can also visit the [Events Plugin GitHub repository](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-events) or the [Adobe I/O CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) to learn more.

## Setup and credentials

To begin setting up the Events Plugin, visit [Adobe Developer Console](https://www.adobe.com/go/devs_console_ui) and create a new project in your organization. For detailed instructions, follow the steps outlined in this tutorial for [creating a new project](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/projects-empty).

Once the project has been created, add the *I/O Management API* service to the project. This will add the required scope to the authentication token required by the Events SDK. For a step-by-step guide to adding an API to a project, follow this tutorial for [adding an API to a project using OAuth Server-to-Server credential](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/services/services-add-api-oauth-s2s) (the type of authentication used by the I/O Management API).
